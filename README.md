HELLO,
WELCOME TO MY PARSER
----------------------

TO RUN MY PARSER IN DR RACKET, TYPE (PARSE <FILENAME>)
AND YOU WILL BE INFORMED OF A SUCCESSFUL PARSE OR 
AN ERROR WILL BE THROWN ON THE APPROPRIATE LINE.
  
I HAVE ALL OF THE TEST FILES DEFINED AS VARIABLES WITHIN THE RACKET PROGRAM SO ALL YOU WILL HAVE TO DO
IS 
(parse file1)
(parse file2)
(parse file3)
etc.....
  
 THE ALGORITHM FOR THE PARSE TAKEN FROM THE MICHAEL SCOTT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE BOOK PAGE 77.
 I HAD TO CONVERT IT INTO FUNCTIONAL, RECURSIVE FORM, BUT THAT IS WHERE THE FUN IS!!!11!!
 I INCLUDED THE REFERENCE TO THE PSEUDO CODE AS A JPEG IN THIS REPOSITORY.
